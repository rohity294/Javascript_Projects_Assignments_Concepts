                 <h3>Water is essential to good health, yet needs vary by individual. These guidelines can help ensure you drink enough fluids.</h3>
                <p>How much water should you drink each day? It's a simple question with no easy answer.</p>

                <p>Studies have produced varying recommendations over the years. But your individual water needs depend on many factors, including your health, how active you are and where you live.</p>

                <p>No single formula fits everyone. But knowing more about your body's need for fluids will help you estimate how much water to drink each day.</p>
                <h2>Staying safely hydrated</h2>
                <p>Your fluid intake is probably adequate if:</p>

                   <p> You rarely feel thirsty
                    Your urine is colorless or light yellow
                    A doctor or registered dietitian can help you determine the amount of water that's right for you every day.</p>

                   <p> To prevent dehydration and make sure your body has the fluids it needs, make water your beverage of choice. It's also a good idea to:

                    Drink a glass of water or other calorie-free or low-calorie beverage with each meal and between each meal.
                    Drink water before, during and after exercise.
                    Drink water if you're feeling hungry. Thirst is often c onfused with hunger.
